      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The term “heart disease” refers to several types of heart conditions. The most common type of heart disease in the United States is coronary artery disease (CAD), which affects the blood flow to the heart. Decreased blood flow can cause a heart attack.

            <p class="text-base text-gray-400">Hey there! I am Shakhyar Gogoi, and I am an young AI developer. I mosly work for deep learning models. I have been studying deep learning for 3 years now, and have been a Co-Lead Developer in an open source Deep Learning Project, <a href='https://youtu.be/YereI6Gn3bM'>TheVoiceAssistant</a>. My favourite architectures are CNN, BERT, RNN, GRU, Seq2Seq, etc</p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">A brief summary of the project <summary>The prediction accuracy of the ML model was 88.7%</summary>
            <summary>The model was based on 'Decision Tree' Architecture</summary>
            <summary>Since there were more Normal values and the dataset was a bit noisy, it wasn't appropriate to remove particular columns from the dataframe. Also this was the reason why I haven't used KNN model, since with KNN, I was getting around just 80% accuracy with just 1 neighbours, when the value of k increased, the accuracy keep dropping. So I had to go for Decision Tree Model.</summary>
            <summary>The model was much lighter when I switched to Decision Tree from KNN</summary>
            <summary>Dataset is based on 4 ".csv"s from different regions, <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/">from UCI machine learning repo</a></summary>
