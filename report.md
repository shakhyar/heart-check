Cardiovascular diseases accounted for 28.1 percent of total deaths in India. 

Heart disease has remained the leading cause of death In India for more than 
two decades fuelled by unhealthy diets leading to high blood pressure and the 
buildup up blood fats (plaque) inside the walls of the arteries, inactivity, obesity and smoking. 
If the people have been diagnosed earlier, they would be safe. But since heart disease diagnosis is 
quite expensive, and since doctors are busy with active heart disease patients, many patients get
ignored as well sometimes. This is actually a big problem.
