Cardiovascular diseases accounted for 28.1% of total deaths in India. 
Most people have this type diseases because of unhealthy diets, less precautions and late diagnosis. If people have been diagnosed earlier, they would be safe. But since heart disease diagnosis is quite expensive, and since the best doctors are busy with active heart disease patients, many patients with less symptoms get ignored sometimes. This is actually a big problem. But there is a solution for everything. 
I have built a heart disease Machine Learning Classifier with an accuracy of 88.7% and hosted it on web so that anyone can check if they have a heart disease or not. The model not only predicts whether you have a disease or not, but also predicts the rate of intensity of your disease. The scope of this approach was to encourage people to take a quick survey that can be a life saver, and it's totally free. The site is up and running at: https://heartcheck.pythonanywhere.com/, and this project is totally open source, so it's up at GitHub at https://github.com/shakhyar/heart-check/
As I hosted this website for free, I couldn't get much CPU and RAM. Therefore I worked with a smaller dataset. I have used Flask, numpy, pandas, and sklearn. The test has been made on multiple Architectures like KNN, SVM, SGD, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree. Out of all, the Decision Tree was more accurate, and was more light weight. Also if we keep scaling the model with bigger data, the KNN model might struggle at some point as this data was very noisy. Since we just want to have the appropriate predictions done, this is the best version for now and is highly scalable.
